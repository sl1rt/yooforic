                            <p>Our supply partners spent years developing special cultivars of the hemp that produce naturally occurring compounds and only trace amounts of THC, the psychoactive compound that gives marijuana users the "high" feeling. In comparison to hemp, most recreational cannabis plants have between 5% to over 20% THC. The hemp oil used in Yooforic chewing gum contains less than 0.1% THC, which is essentially none!</p>
